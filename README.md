# Parkinson-Detection
This repository contains the semester project for the course B52 Artificial Intelligence and Big Data Analytics (Winter Semester 2025/26) in the study program Informatics in Culture and Health at HTW Berlin.

The project explores the use of machine learning and audio-based AI methods for the analysis of speech and frequency data related to Parkinson’s disease. Different publicly available datasets are analyzed separately, including both tabular acoustic features and raw audio recordings, in order to compare classical machine learning approaches with modern audio-based methods.

The course is taught by Alexander Hinzer.
